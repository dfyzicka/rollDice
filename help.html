<b>Rollem Bot - Help</b>
This bot allows you to roll all kinds of dice in your Telegram messages. To roll dice, you can use the <code>/roll</code> or <code>/r</code> commands, followed by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation'>dice notation</a> with no spaces in it.
For example: <code>/r 4d10+3d6</code>

<b>Highest/Lowest **NEW**</b>
You can take only the highest or lowest result from a set of dice by adding an H or L to the dice notation (lowercase works too). This is for rules like D&D 5e's advantage and disadvantage.
For example: <code>/r 2d20h+3 Int + Advantage</code>

<b>Exploding Dice</b>
Exploding dice are dice that can roll again and add to the total when the highest number on the die is rolled. These are used in games like Savage Worlds. To roll exploding dice, add an exclamation point at the end of the dice notation.
For example: <code>/r d20!+2</code>

<b>Fate Dice</b>
To roll Fate or Fudge dice, you can use the <code>4dF</code> notation, or the shorthand command <code>/rf</code>. Adding a number after the <code>/rf</code> will add it to the total of the four Fate dice. So <code>/rf 3</code> will roll 4 Fate dice and add 3 to the result.

<b>Comments</b>
You can add comments to the end of a roll by separating it from the equation with a space, like this: <code>/r 8d6 Fireball!!!</code>

<b>Support</b>
This bot was created and is worked on in my free time and it is hosted on a server that I pay for with my own money. If you would like to say thanks, support further development, or check out some of my other projects, take a look at the links below.
